  <h2>Introduction </h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Alexander Foster. I am an aspiring Web Developer crossed with a musician. I love tacos.</p>
  <p>There are many things in life I deem "important", these being: Family, Friends, Success, Self Worth, but,  in the end all we really need is love.</p>

 <h2>More About Me! </h2>
  
  <p>My favorite hobbies consist of: Skateboarding, singing, guitar, hanging out with friends and of course dabbling with the vast range of technologies on the web.</p>
  <p> My dream job wouldn't be to be a Web Developer per-say but instead a working musician. I love the idea of touring and making people happy but have never had the chance to put enoguh time into making music a career, because...well music doesnt pay the bills right off the bat. Web development was always my second choice and I have had the chance to work as one professionally for a short time. Now i look to do it as a freelancer.</p>
  <p>The music I listen too has always come straight out of the 90's i love bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots and Radiohead, but you can never go wrong adding to Led Zepplin or The Beatles into the mix.</p>
